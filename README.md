# 🚗 Car Parking Occupancy Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Car Parking Occupancy Prediction System** is a machine learning–based solution designed to detect and predict the availability of parking spaces using images of parking areas. The system classifies parking slots as **Occupied** or **Vacant**, helping reduce traffic congestion, fuel consumption, and time spent searching for parking.

This project uses **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning** techniques to automate parking space detection in urban environments.
